# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This project is a weather dashboard that will display the weather details of whatever city you enter. This is my first time using a server API which made the project quite difficult as I had to learn how to get the information and then format it to display on my website. Additionally, I used a CSS framework for the first time. Compared to plain CSS, it is so much easier to use. It didn't take me forever to align everything on my page like it normally did. I am very proud of my work on this project.
